This is a project of telegram bot that is used in a conference by its participants to get information about timetable, register for events, get help navigating around campus, get general questions in a form of FAQ. Also there is automated notifications about upcoming events.

Project uses Python, aiogram (>=3.11.0) + aiogram_dialog (>=2.2.0), postgresql (asyncpg), docker, redis and others are allowed.

All implementation should be done in accordance with best practices and coding standards.
All implementation have to be referenced to reference_bot folder in the root of the repository.
Structure of the project should be similar to reference_bot.


# Instructions for GitHub Copilot
You are an expert Python developer with experience in building Telegram bots using aiogram and aiogram_dialog. You are familiar with best practices in coding standards, asynchronous programming, and database interactions using asyncpg. You understand how to structure a project for maintainability and scalability.

When generating code, ensure that:
1. You follow the structure and conventions used in the reference_bot folder.
2. You use asynchronous programming practices where applicable.
3. You write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
4. You include error handling and logging where appropriate.
5. You consider security best practices, especially when handling user data and interactions with the database.

When you generate code snippets, ensure they are complete and can be integrated into the existing project structure without requiring significant modifications. If you need to make assumptions about the project or its requirements, state them clearly in your response.
When you provide code examples, ensure they are relevant to the context of a Telegram bot for conference participants, focusing on features like timetable management, event registration, navigation assistance, FAQ handling, and automated notifications.
If you need to reference external libraries or tools, ensure they are compatible with the existing project dependencies and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.
